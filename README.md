# Reventure Twitch Fix

The Twitch integration of Reventure currently breaks when certain emotes get posted in the chat.
This BepInEx plugin fixes the problem.

## Installation

1. First time only: Copy the contents of the [BepInEx zip][BepInExZip] into the Reventure installation folder (usually `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Reventure`)
2. Copy the contents of the [latest ReventureTwitchFix.zip][LatestRelease] into the `BepInEx/Plugins` folder inside of the Reventure installation folder
